## üéº Introduction
This project is a practical application of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** in the music industry. The Music Recommendation System suggests songs by analyzing an individual's music tastes and finding similar tracks. It combines **content-based filtering** and **popularity-weighted scoring** to generate balanced recommendations that are both relevant and trendy.

By accessing **Spotify's vast music catalog** through their API, the project showcases how to utilize real-time data in action and learn the fundamentals of building a recommendation engine from scratch.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends songs based on similarities in audio features like tempo, energy, and danceability.
- **Popularity-Weighted Scoring**: Adjusts recommendations based on the popularity of tracks, with a higher emphasis on recent releases.
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Combines content-based recommendations with weighted popularity for a more personalized experience.
- **Spotify API Integration**: Uses the Spotify API to fetch track metadata, audio features, and popularity scores.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for the project.
- **Spotify API**: Used to fetch real-time music data and metadata.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For cosine similarity calculations in content-based filtering.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and visualization.
